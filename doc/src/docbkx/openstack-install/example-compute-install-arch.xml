    <title>Example Compute Installation Architectures</title>
    <para>OpenStack architecture consists of these major
        components: Compute, Object Storage, Identity, and Images.
        A common Identity component provides authentication for
        users to have access to these components. The Image
        service stores and serves images to run virtual machines.
        Compute uses a shared-nothing, messaging-based
        architecture. While very flexible, the fact that you can
        install each nova- service on an independent server means
        there are many possible methods for installing OpenStack
        Compute. The only co-dependency between possible
        multi-node installations is that the Dashboard must be
        installed on a server running the nova-api service. Here
        are the types of installation architectures for OpenStack
        Compute with the Image and Identity Services:</para>

            <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"
                >Single node, Compute-only: Only one server runs
                all nova- services and also drives all the virtual
                instances. Use this configuration only for trying
                out OpenStack Compute, or for development
                purposes.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Two nodes, Compute-only: A cloud controller node runs the nova-
            services except for nova-compute, and a compute
            node runs nova-compute. A client computer is
            likely needed to bundle images and interfacing to
            the servers, but a client is not required. Use
            this configuration for proof of concepts or
            development environments. </para></listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook">Multiple
                nodes, Compute-only: You can add more compute
                nodes to the two node installation by simply
                installing nova-compute on an additional server
                and copying a nova.conf file to the added node.
                This would result in a multiple node installation.
                You can also add a volume controller and a network
                controller as additional nodes in a more complex
                multiple node installation. A minimum of 4 nodes
                is best for running multiple virtual instances
                that require a lot of processing power.</para>

        Compute; virtual server networking in the cluster may vary.</para>

    <para>An alternative architecture would be to add more messaging servers if you notice a lot
        of back up in the messaging queue causing performance problems. In that case you would
        add an additional RabbitMQ server in addition to or instead of scaling up the database
        server. Your installation can run any nova- service on any server as long as the
        nova.conf is configured to point to the RabbitMQ server and the server can send messages
        to the server.</para>
    <para>Multiple installation architectures are possible, here is another example
        illustration. </para>
