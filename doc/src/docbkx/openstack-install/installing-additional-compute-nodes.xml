    <title>Installing Additional Compute Nodes</title>
    <para>There are many different ways to perform a multinode install
        of Compute in order to scale out your deployment and run more
        compute nodes, enabling more virtual machines to run
        simultaneously. </para>
    <para>In this case, you can install all the nova- packages and
        dependencies as you did for the Cloud Controller node, or just
        install nova-network and nova-compute. Your installation can
        run any nova- services anywhere, so long as the service can
        access <filename>nova.conf</filename> so it knows where the
        Rabbitmq or Qpid messaging server is installed.</para>
    <para>The Compute Node is where you configure the Compute network,
        the networking between your instances. </para>
    <para>Because you may need to query the database from the Compute
        node and learn more information about instances, the nova
        client and MySQL client or PostgresSQL client packages should
        be installed on any additional Compute nodes.</para>
    <para>Copy the <filename>nova.conf</filename> from your controller
        node to all additional compute nodes.</para>
