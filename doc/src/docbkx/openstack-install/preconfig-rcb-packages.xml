    <title>Preconfiguring with Cloud Builders Packages</title>
    <para>These packages are used by the Crowbar project and Rackspace
        Cloud Builders deployments. However, there are no plans to
        maintain these packages. See the source of these packages at
        https://github.com/rcbops.</para>
    <para>First, you need to add a signing key for the Cloud Builders
        repository that contains packages that are known and tested to
        work together, such as diablo-d5 or diablo-final. Once you add
        the signing key, you add a repository entry pointing to it and
        update your repo pointer with an apt-get command. </para>
    <literallayout class="monospaced">sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://subkeys.pgp.net --recv F87CBDE0</literallayout>
    <para>Now, create a new sources.list and add a pointer to the
        Rackspace Cloud Builders packages for a finalized Diablo
        release containing Compute, Object Storage, Image Service,
        the Dashboard, and Identity Service.</para>
    <literallayout class="monospaced">sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rcb-sources.list           </literallayout>
    <para>Paste the following line into the newly created
        rcb-sources.list file. The options are maverick (10.11), natty
        (11.04), or oneiric (11.10) for the operating system and
        diablo-d5 or diablo-final for the related release text:</para>
    <literallayout class="monospaced">deb http://ops.rcb.me/packages oneiric diablo-final</literallayout>
    <para>Now update to pick up this repository.</para>
    <literallayout class="monospaced">sudo apt-get update</literallayout>
