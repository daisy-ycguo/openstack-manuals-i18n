    <para>You can download a script for a standalone install
        for proof-of-concept, learning, or for development
        purposes for Ubuntu 11.04 at <link
            xlink:href="http://devstack.org"
            >https://devstack.org</link>. This is not a
        permanent installation.</para>

        <listitem><para>Install Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty):</para> <para>In order to correctly install all the dependencies, we assume a specific version of Ubuntu to
            make it as easy as possible. OpenStack works on other flavors of Linux (and
            some folks even run it on Windows!) We recommend using a minimal install of
            Ubuntu server in a VM if this is your first time.</para></listitem>

            <literallayout class="monospaced">git clone git://github.com/cloudbuilders/devstack.git</literallayout>
            <para>The devstack repo contains a script that
                installs OpenStack Compute with the Image
                Service and the Identity Service and OpenStack
                Object Storage. It offers templates for
                configuration files plus data scripts. </para></listitem>
        
        
        
        <listitem><para>Start the install:</para><literallayout class="monospaced">cd devstack; ./stack.sh</literallayout><para>It takes a few minutes, we recommend <link xlink:href="http://devstack.org/stack.sh.html"

            more about what is going on. </para>

    <para>You can also install a more permanent deployment using an upstart script after running the devstack script.</para> 
    <para>Once you have tested stack.sh and tailored it to
        your system, you can convert the installation into
        upstart services. The additions with this script are
        the ability to run services like daemons instead of in
        screens, to store logs in files and offer an automatic
        start up after a reboot.</para>
    
    <para>It works with glance- services, nova- services,
        novnc, and keystone, but not with quantum or swift as
        of November 22 2011. Here are the basic steps.</para>

            <para>The devstack repo contains a script that installs OpenStack Compute, the Image

    <para>Now the services are installed. To use them, either
        reboot to get rid of the services started by stack.sh,
        and automatically start those services, or do killall
        screen, then: </para><literallayout class="monospaced">./upstart.sh start</literallayout>
