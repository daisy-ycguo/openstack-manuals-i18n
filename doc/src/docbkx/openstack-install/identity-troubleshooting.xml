    <title>Troubleshooting the Identity Service (Keystone)</title>
    <para>To begin troubleshooting, look at the logs in the
            <filename>/var/log/keystone.log</filename> file (the
        location of log files is configured in the
            <filename>/etc/keystone/logging.conf</filename> file). It
        shows all the components that have come in to the WSGI
        request, and will ideally have an error in that log that
        explains why an authorization request failed. If you're not
        seeing the request at all in those logs, then run keystone
        with "--debug" where --debug is passed in directly after the
        CLI command prior to parameters.</para>
