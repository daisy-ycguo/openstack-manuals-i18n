    <para>For production environments the most tested hypervisors are
        KVM and Xen-based hypervisors. KVM runs through libvirt, Xen
        runs best through XenAPI calls. KVM is selected by default and
        requires the least additional configuration. This guide offers
        information on both but the specific walkthrough configuration
        options set up KVM.</para></section>
