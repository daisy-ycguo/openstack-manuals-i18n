    <para>For both conserving network resources and ensuring that
        network administrators understand the needs for networks and
        public IP addresses for providing access to the APIs and
        storage network as necessary, this section offers
        recommendations and required minimum sizes. Throughput of at
        least 1000 Mbps is suggested. </para>
  <para>This document refers to two networks. One is a Public Network for
        connecting to the Proxy server, and the second is a Storage Network that is not
        accessible from outside the cluster, to which all of the nodes are
        connected. All of the OpenStack Object Storage services, as well as
        the rsync daemon on the Storage nodes are configured to listen on
        their STORAGE_LOCAL_NET IP addresses.</para>
    <para>Public Network (Publicly routable IP range): This network is utilized for providing Public IP accessibility to the API endpoints within the cloud infrastructure.
    </para>
        <para>Minimum size: 8 IPs (CIDR /29)</para>
    <para>Storage Network (RFC1918 IP Range, not publicly routable):
        This network is utilized for all inter-server communications
        within the Object Storage infrastructure. </para>
    <para>Recommended size: 255 IPs (CIDR /24)</para></section>
