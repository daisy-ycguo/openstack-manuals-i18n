    <title>Preconfiguring with Managed IT Packages</title>
    <para>These packages are made with builds of Diablo with
        backported fixes. They are intended for use on Ubuntu 11.10,
        Oneiric, and provided by Managed IT. </para>
    <para>First, ensure you have python-software-properties installed,
        and then you need to add the repository: </para>
    <literallayout class="monospaced">sudo apt-get install python-software-properties 
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:managedit/openstack</literallayout>
    <para>Now, update to ensure the package repository is picked up by
        your system:</para>
    <literallayout class="monospaced">sudo apt-get update</literallayout>
    <para>Now ensure that these packages are used instead of those
        bundled with Ubuntu:</para>
    <literallayout class="monospaced">sudo apt-get install -y managedit-openstack-pin</literallayout>
    <para>If you don't want to go through the manual install process,
        refer to <link
            xlink:href="https://github.com/managedit/openstack-setup"
            >https://github.com/managedit/openstack-setup</link> for
        scripts and template files for the configuration files.</para>
