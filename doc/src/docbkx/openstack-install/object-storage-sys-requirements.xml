            <td><para>The amount of disk space depends on how much you can fit into
                        the rack efficiently. You want to optimize
                        these for best cost per GB while still getting
                        industry-standard failure rates. At Rackspace,
                        our storage servers are currently running
                        fairly generic 4U servers with 24 2T SATA
                        drives and 8 cores of processing power. RAID
                        on the storage drives is not required and not
                        recommended. Swift's disk usage pattern is the
                        worst case possible for RAID, and performance
                        degrades very quickly using RAID 5 or
                        6.</para>
                <para>As an example, Rackspace runs Cloud
                    Files storage servers with 24 2T SATA
                    drives and 8 cores of processing power.
                    Most services support either a worker or
                    concurrency value in the settings. This
                    allows the services to make effective use
                    of the cores available.</para></td></tr>

                        performance. The Proxy Services are more
                        CPU and network I/O intensive. If you are
                        using 10g networking to the proxy, or are
                        terminating SSL traffic at the proxy,
                        greater CPU power will be required.</para></td></tr></tbody></table>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Operating System</emphasis>: OpenStack
        Object Storage currently runs on Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, or
        Fedora and the large scale deployment at Rackspace runs on
        Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Networking</emphasis>: 1000 Mbps are suggested. For
        OpenStack Object Storage, an external network should connect the outside
        world to the proxy servers, and the storage network is intended to be
        isolated on a private network or multiple private networks. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Database</emphasis>: For OpenStack Object Storage, a
        SQLite database is part of the OpenStack Object Storage container and
        account management process.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Permissions</emphasis>: You can install OpenStack Object
        Storage either as root or as a user with sudo permissions if you configure
        the sudoers file to enable all the permissions.</para>
