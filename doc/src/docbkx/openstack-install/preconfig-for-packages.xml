    <title>Preconfiguring for Cloud Builders Packages</title>
    <para>These packages are unsupported but known to work and are used by the Crowbar project and Rackspace Cloud Builders deployments. First, you need to add a signing key for the Cloud
        Builders repository that contains packages that are known
        and tested to work together, such as diablo-d5 or
        diablo-final. Once you add the signing key, you add a
        repository entry pointing to it and update your repo
        pointer with an apt-get command. </para>
    <literallayout class="monospaced">sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://subkeys.pgp.net --recv F87CBDE0</literallayout>
    <para>Now, create a new sources.list and add a pointer to the
        Rackspace Cloud Builders packages for a finalized Diablo
        release containing Compute, Object Storage, Image Service,
        the Dashboard, and Identity Service.</para>
    <literallayout class="monospaced">sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rcb-sources.list           </literallayout>
    <para>Paste the following line into the newly created
        rcb-sources.list file. The options are maverick (10.11), natty
        (11.04), or oneiric (11.10) for the operating system and
        diablo-d5 or diablo-final for the related release
        parts:</para>
    <literallayout class="monospaced">deb http://ops.rcb.me/packages natty diablo-final</literallayout>
    <para>Now update to pick up this repository.</para>
    <literallayout class="monospaced">sudo apt-get update</literallayout>
