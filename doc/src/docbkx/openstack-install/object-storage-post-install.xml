                <title>Adding an Additional Proxy Server</title>
                <para>For reliability&#8217;s sake you may want to
                        have more than one proxy server. You can set
                        up the additional proxy node in the same
                        manner that you set up the first proxy node
                        but with additional configuration
                        steps.</para>
                <para>Once you have more than two proxies, you also
                        want to load balance between the two, which
                        means your storage endpoint (what clients use 
                        to connect to your storage) also changes. You
                        can select from different strategies for load
                        balancing. For example, you could use round
                        robin dns, or a software or hardware load 
                        balancer (like pound) in front of the two 
                        proxies, and point your storage url to the 
                        load balancer.</para>
                <para>Configure an initial proxy node for the initial
                        setup, and then follow these additional steps
                        for more proxy servers.</para>
