    <para>For both conserving network resources and ensuring that
        network administrators understand the needs for networks and
        public IP addresses for accessing the APIs and VMs as
        necessary, this section offers recommendations and required
        minimum sizes. Throughput of at least 1000 Mbps is suggested.
        This walkthrough shows network configurations for a single
        server.</para>
    <para>For OpenStack Compute, networking is configured on
        multi-node installations between the physical machines on
        a single subnet. For networking between virtual machine
        instances, three network options are available: flat,
        DHCP, and VLAN. Two NICs (Network Interface Cards) are
        recommended on the server running nova-network.</para>
    <para>Management Network (RFC1918 IP Range, not publicly
        routable): This network is utilized for all inter-server
        communications within the cloud infrastructure. Recommended
        size: 255 IPs (CIDR /24)</para>
    <para>Public Network (Publicly routable IP range): This network is
        utilized for providing Public IP accessibility to the API
        endpoints within the cloud infrastructure. Minimum size: 8 IPs
        (CIDR /29)</para>
    <para>VM Network (RFC1918 IP Range, not publicly routable): This
        network is utilized for providing primary IP addresses to the
        cloud instances. Recommended size: 1024 IPs (CIDR /22)</para>
    <para>Floating IP network (Publicly routable IP Range): This
        network is utilized for providing Public IP accessibility to
        selected cloud instances. Minimum size: 16 IPs (CIDR
        /28)</para></section>
