== The Pacemaker Cluster Stack

OpenStack high availability relies on the
http://www.clusterlabs.org[Pacemaker] cluster stack, the
state-of-the-art high availability and load balancing stack for the
Linux platform. Pacemaker is storage and application agnostic, and is
in no way specific to OpenStack.

Pacemaker relies on the http://www.corosync.org[Corosync] messaging
layer for reliable cluster communications. Corosync implements the
Totem single-ring ordering and membership protocol and provides UDP
and InfiniBand based messaging, quorum, and cluster membership to
Pacemaker.

Pacemaker interacts with applications through _resource agents_ (RAs),
of which it supports over 70 natively. Pacemaker can also easily use
third-party RAs. An OpenStack high-availability configuration uses
existing native Pacemaker RAs (such as those managing MySQL
databases or virtual IP addresses), existing third-party RAs (such as
for RabbitMQ), and native OpenStack RAs (such as those managing the
OpenStack Identity and Image Services).
