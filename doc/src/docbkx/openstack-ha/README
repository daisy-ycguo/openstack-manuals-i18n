This directory contains what's eventually intended to become reference
documentation for OpenStack High Availability.

Contrary to the rest of the documentation which is straight-up
DocBook, this guide is being maintained, at least for the time being,
in AsciiDoc. AsciiDoc processing is currently not supported by the
Maven toolchain, so as a stop-gap measure until such support becomes
available, please do this if you want to send a patch:

1. Make your change to the AsciiDoc source file (.txt). The syntax
   should be self explanatory-and intuitive to anyone who's ever used
   something like Markdown or RST. The AsciiDoc cheatsheet is an
   extremely useful resource: http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc

2. Pipe your stuff through AsciiDoc. Here's one catch: AsciiDoc
   currently doesn't fully support DocBook 5, but the Maven toolchain
   requires it. So you'll have to run your AsciiDoc output through the
   "db4upgrade.xsl" stylesheet that ships with DocBook 5.

3. Finally, indent your resulting XML with two spaces. This should
   produce a clean patch against bk-ha-guide.xml which you can then
   submit to Gerrit along with your .txt file patch.

Here's a command line you can use with AsciiDoc, xsltproc and xmllint
to achieve all of the above:

asciidoc -b docbook -d book -o - ha-guide.txt | \
  xsltproc -o - /path/to/db4-upgrade.xsl - | \
  xmllint -o bk-ha-guide.xml --format -

There's one more quirk: in the transformation, AsciiDoc discards the
"xml:id" attribute on the root <book> element. The Maven toolchain
requires this, so please re-add it so the root element.
