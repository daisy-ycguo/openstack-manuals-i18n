There’s no way to increment a counter by more than one or send timing data to StatsD based on the log line content. The tool could be extended to handle more metrics per line and data extraction, including timing data. But even then, there would still be a coupling between the log textual format and the log parsing regexes, which would themselves be more complex in order to support multiple matches per line and data extraction. Also, log processing introduces a delay between the triggering event and sending the data to StatsD. We would prefer to increment error counters where they occur, send timing data as soon as it is known, avoid coupling between a log string and a parsing regex, and not introduce a time delay between events and sending data to StatsD.

msgid "In the Object Store (swift) project there is a tool that can perform a variety of tasks on your storage cluster named swift. This client utility can be used for adhoc processing, to gather statistics, list items, update metadata, upload, download and delete files. It is based on the native swift client library client.py. Incorporating client.py into swift provides many benefits such as seamlessly re-authorizing if the current token expires in the middle of processing, retrying operations up to five times and a processing concurrency of 10. All of these things help make the swift tool robust and great for operational use."
