  <title>LXC (Linux containers)</title>
  <para>LXC (also known as Linux containers) is a virtualization technology that works at the
    operating system level. This is different from hardware virtualization, the approach used by
    other hypervisors such as KVM, Xen, and VMWare.</para>
  <para>If your compute hosts do not have hardware support for virtualization, LXC will likely
    provide better performance than QEMU. In addition, if your guests need to access to specialized
    hardware (e.g., GPUs), this may be easier to achieve with LXC than other hypervisors.</para>
  <note><para>Some OpenStack Compute features may be missing when running with LXC as the hypervisor. See
      the <link xlink:href="http://wiki.openstack.org/HypervisorSupportMatrix">hypervisor support
        matrix</link> for details.</para></note>
  <para>To enable LXC, ensure the following options are set in
      <filename>/etc/nova/nova.conf</filename> on all hosts running the <systemitem class="service"
      >nova-compute</systemitem>
    service.<programlisting>connection_type=libvirt
libvirt_type=lxc</programlisting></para>
  <para>On Ubuntu 12.04, enable LXC support in OpenStack by installing the
      <literal>nova-compute-lxc</literal> package.</para>
