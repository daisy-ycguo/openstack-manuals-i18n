    <title>OpenStack Interfaces</title>

    <para>OpenStack has components that provide a view of the
        OpenStack installation such as a Django-built website that
        serves as a dashboard and the ability to connect to running
        instances using a VNC connection via a VNC Proxy.</para>

        <title>About the Dashboard</title>
        <?dbhtml stop-chunking?>
        <para>You can use a dashboard interface with an OpenStack
            Compute installation with a web-based console provided by
            the Openstack-Dashboard project. It provides web-based
            interactions with the OpenStack Compute cloud controller
            through the OpenStack APIs. For more information about the
            Openstack-Dashboard project, please visit: <link

                >https://github.com/openstack/horizon/</link>. These
            instructions are for an example deployment configured with
            an Apache web server. </para>
